/*
Katrina has a string ‘s’ consisting of one or more of the following letters: a, e, i, o, u. We define a 
magical subsequence of letters derived from s that contains all five vowels in order. This 
means a magical subsequence will have one or more a’s followed by the one or more s 
followed by one or more i’s followed by one or more o’s followed by one or more u’s. For 
example, if s = “aeeiooua”, then “aeiou” and “aeeioou” are magical subsequences but “aeio” 
and “aeeioua” are not.
