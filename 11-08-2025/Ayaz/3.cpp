/*
There is a road, which can be represented as a number line. You are located in the point 0 of the number line, and you want to travel from the point 0 to the point x, and back to the point 0.
You travel by car, which spends 1 liter of gasoline per 1 unit of distance travelled. When you start at the point 0, your car is fully fueled (its gas tank contains the maximum possible amount of fuel).
There are n gas stations, located in points a1,a2,â€¦,an. When you arrive at a gas station, you fully refuel your car. Note that you can refuel only at gas stations, and there are no gas stations in points 0 and x.
You have to calculate the minimum possible volume of the gas tank in your car (in liters) that will allow you to travel from the point 0 to the point x and back to the point 0.
